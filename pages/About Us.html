      Everyone has their choice, some opt for the five-star

      of the best hotels like accommodations near Universal Studios

     honeymoon, then it is better to collect all the 
     details one month before the departure regarding
      hotels and their availability. Booking a hotel on 
      the spot might cause trouble for you or you will 
      not get the desired hotel, so it is good to plan all
       the things before your trip.
    <hr>
    Make sure to collect all the details regarding
    the most comfortable and luxurious hotel available
     in the town or city you are going to visit to avoid
      any inconvenience and nuisance.
    
    Here in this article, we are going to share all 
    the qualities which a good and great hotel must 
    have from taking care of its guests to provide 
    tasty and yummy food and other luxuries to make 
    their stay memorable and unforgettable.
    
<hr>

    CHARACTERISTICS OF A GREAT HOTEL:
    
    Either it is a two-star hotel or a five-star hotel, 
    it should have some following qualities to become a
     good accommodation place for the tourist and guests.
    
 <hr>

    Letâ€™s discuss them one by one.
            <hr>

    1. A WARM WELCOME BY THE STAFF
    
    Either it is your first time in a hotel or more than that,
     a good hotel should have the staff that welcomes their guests
      every time with the pretentious smile on their faces.
       They should always greet their guests in a way that it
        looks they care for them and they are always welcome here,
         regardless of any class difference, they should do this as
          a part of their generosity, not as a part of their job.
    
     2.  PROVIDES HONEST INFORMATION
    
    Nothing is more than honesty, either you are 
    running a business or a hotel, in both cases,
     your honesty towards your clients or guests matters a lot. 
     It is the moral duty of the hotel staff to provide honest
      and correct information regarding the charges of room and 
      the services provided by the hotel. They should give true
       information to the tourist about the sites of the city which 
       they can visit in the minimum budget instead of promoting the
       sites for which they are getting a commission to promote them.
    
    3. KIND TO PROVIDE EXTRA SUPPORT
    
<hr>

    A good hotel should always be ready to provide 
    and give extra support to their guests no matter what.
     They should always be available for their guests in 
     case of any emergency or mishap, and always look after
      their guests and provide the rooms that are properly
       ready instead of adjusting them in any unprepared and 
       disorganized room. It is better to arrange the room
        in any nearby hotel and if not possible then tell them 
        honestly that no room is available instead of squeezing 
        your guest into a dirty room.
    
    4. LOCATION OF THE HOTEL

    <hr>
    
    Either it is a shop, a restaurant, or a hotel, 
    the most important thing is the location. 
    The location of your hotel should be extremely
     good and a bit different from other cheap hotels
     . It is good to get or build a hotel near a natural
      location like a waterfall, etc. that serve beautiful
       location to the guests from the balconies of their 
       luxuries suites and amazing services by your well-trained staff.
        The hotels located in such places are mostly far away
         from the city and a bit expensive. But they provide 
         extra services to their guests when they are paying a
          huge amount to achieve all these benefits like transport
           services to shop and travel easily from hotel to other
            interesting locations.
    
                <hr>

    5. CLEANLINESS COMES FIRST
    
    The cleanliness and hygiene are very important, not
    only in your room but in your washroom and the place
     where you are dining. A good hotel always takes care
      of such petty things as these are the small, little 
      things that help in making your name in the industry
       and win the trust of your guests. Not only the rooms 
       etc. but the staff responsible for the cleaning and other
        things should also be neat and clean to exhibit the importance
         of hygiene and cleanliness in the hotel.

         <hr>
    
    6. SHOULD NOT CHARGE EXTRA
    
    Hotels can never be good and famous, until and
     unless they put the hospitality of the guests first 
     instead of running it as a business to earn dollars from them. 
     They should always be generous and kind towards their guests and 
     take care of their little things. If you have a hotel and want to
      be a great one then it is good to stop charging extra money for 
      the little services like Wi-Fi or extra soap, etc.
    
    7. FEEL LIKE A HOME
    
    The staff and the services of the hotel should be good 
    enough to provide comfort and care to the guests so they 
    feel like they are at home. Their breakfast should be ready
     
     <hr>
    and serve uniquely and differently to make them feel special.
    
    8. FAST SERVICE
    
    Make sure the service of your hotel should be extra fast and
     staff should always be ready to assist the guests even at midnight.
      The staff of the hotel should assure that everything is at their
       place and the guests are having a pleasant and wonderful time here.
    
    9. ROOMS SHOULD BE SPACIOUS
    
    The rooms of the hotel should be spacious enough to accommodate
     the guests and their luggage properly, it should not only be
      spacious but comfortable with all the necessities and luxuries 
      like a tiny fridge having chocolates and champagne, etc. A large
       T.V with a king-size bed for comfortable sleep at night.
    
<hr> 

    10. RECREATION AREAS
    
    A hotel can never become the top and a famous hotel 
    unless it has some recreation areas for the entertainment
     of its guests like a big size swimming pool where people 
     can enjoy and have some fun. In the same way, a gym in the 
     hotel is a must, especially for the people who are extremely
      health-conscious and cannot afford to miss their gym.
    

      <hr>
    SUMMARY
    
    To become a good and great hotel for the 
    accommodation of the guests, your hotel must
     serve all the necessities and luxuries which
     are important to entertain any guest from taking 
     care of his breakfast to providing the best and
      luxurious suite with all the basics and recreation areas. 
      Your hotel should provide comfort and make him feel like home.
