            Either it is a shop, a restaurant,
            or a hotel, the most important thing is the location.
            The location of your hotel should be extremely good and a bit different from other cheap hotels. 
            It is good to get or build a hotel near a natural location like a waterfall, etc.
            that serve beautiful location to the guests from the balconies of their luxuries suites and amazing services by your well-trained staff.
            The hotels located in such places are mostly far away from the city and a bit expensive.
            But they provide extra services to their guests when they are paying a huge amount to achieve all these benefits like 
            transport services to shop and travel easily from h
            tel to other interesting locations.
